Algorithms and data structures, WIET AGH
This repo consist of my own implementations of common algorithms.

1)Sorting algorithms:

	a)insertion sort
	
	b)buble sort
	
	c)selection sort
	
	d)quick sort
	
	e)merge sort
	
	f)heap sort
	
	g)bucket sort
	
	h)radix sort
	
2)Basic data structures:

	a)Skiplist
	
	b)Hash Table (open addressing)
	
 	c)Trees (only BST is implemented however general knowledge of Splay Tree, Red-Black Tree and AVL Tree was required)
	
3)Graph algorithms:

	a)DFS
	
	b)BFS
	
 	c)Finding Eulerian Cycle
	
  	d)Kruskal
	
	e)Prim
	
	f)Finding connected components
	
	g)Dijkstra
	
	h)Topologic Sort
	
	i)Floydâ€“Warshall
	
	j)Bellman-Ford
	
4)Dynamic Programing/Greedy Algorithms

	a)Unbounded knapsack problem
	
	b)0/1 knapsack problem
	
	c)Longest common subsequence
	
	d)Task scheduler
